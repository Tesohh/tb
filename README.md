# `tb`
a terminal browser

## why
My friend has a very old laptop running Linux with no GUI so he cannot view any webpage, 
so that inspired me to make a terminal browser.

## what `tb` stands for
`tb` is not really an acronym, but here are some potential names:
- Terminal browser
- [Torcol](https://github.com/Tesohh/torcolrs) Browser
- Tubre browser
- Terbium (the element, inspired by chromium)
