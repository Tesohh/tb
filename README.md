# `tb`
a terminal browser

## why
My friend has a very old laptop running Linux with no GUI so he cannot view any webpage, 
so that inspired me to make a terminal browser.

## what `tb` stands for
`tb` is not really an acronym, but here are some potential names:
- Terminal browser
- [Torcol](https://github.com/Tesohh/torcolrs) Browser
- Tubre browser
- The browser
- Terbium (the element, inspired by chromium)


## credits
Special thanks to Matt Brubeck for his excellent 
[series of articles](https://limpet.net/mbrubeck/2014/08/08/toy-layout-engine-1.html) on building a browser engine. 
His work was incredibly helpful when I was starting out.

This project builds on his approach, though the web engine implementation diverges 
significantly toward the end to support additional features and improvements.
